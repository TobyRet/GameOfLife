If a living cell has less than two living neighbors, it is dead in the next generation, as if by underpopulation.
If a living cell has two or three living neighbors, it stays alive in the next generation.
If a living cell has more than three living neighbors, it is dead in the next generation, as if by overcrowding.
If a dead cell has exactly three living neighbors, it comes to life in the next generation.
